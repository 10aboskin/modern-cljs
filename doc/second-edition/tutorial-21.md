# Tutorial 21 The Real World

In the [previous tutorial][1] we enhanced the `build.boot` building
file to be able to install a CLJ/CLJS library to the local `maven`
repository and finally publish it to
[`clojars`](https://clojars.org/).

In this tutorial we're coming back to the Clojure(Script)
programming language by introducing the most explained and commented
library in the brief history of this awesome programming language:
[`core.async`](https://github.com/clojure/core.async).

## Preamble

To start working, assuming you've git installed, do as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
cd modern-cljs
git checkout se-tutorial-18
```

## Introduction

There is no way I could explain the
[`core.async`](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) library any
better than others already did, given that between the others we're
talking about, you'll find
[Rich Hickey](https://github.com/richhickey), the inventor of
Clojure(Script) and `core.async` library as well,
[Timothy Baldridge](https://github.com/halgari), the guy that
implemented the
[`go` macro](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/a833f6262cdaf92c6b16dd201d1876e0de424e14/src/main/clojure/cljs/core/async/macros.clj)
and [David Nolen](), perhaps the most fruitful and persevering
clojurian and current maintainer of the ClojureScript compiler.

Thats said, this is a series of tutorials for serious CLJS beginners
and I can't avoid to afford the `core.async` topic as well, because of
the event-based nature of the browser itself.

## Nothing new under the sun

The computational model adopted by `core.async` and named
[Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)
has been established in the seventies by
[Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare), the same
British scientist who invented the Quick Sort algorithm in the
sixties.

Even if a bunch of very innovative programming languages implemented
the CSP computational model,
[The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/) was the one that 30
years later, at the end of 2009, brought to CSP some notoriety in the
programming communities. The `core.async` library is directly inspired
to the corresponding characteristics of the `go` programming language.

## Synchronous computation

Let's start very easy. In the standard synchronous model of
computation, when a function (caller) calls another function (callee),
the caller waits for the result of the callee to be able to proceed
with the computation, as in the following example:

```clj
(h (g (f arg)))
```

which is equivalent to a function composition like this:

```clj
((comp h g f) arg)
```

The prefix nature of LISP expressions could make the above forms of
nested function calls difficult to be read. Actually, LISP source
files have to be read bottom-up and inside-out to understand the order
of execution. Aside from the complaint about the number of parentheses
used by LISP, which is not even true, the second most controversial
aspect of the LISP syntax regards the cited way to read the code.

To overcome that reading difficulty, Clojure offers two threading
macros, namely the threading first macro (i.e., `->`) and the
threading last macro (i.e., `->>`). By using the threading first
macro, but in such a case we could have used the threading last macro
as well, the above function composition is transformed in a form that
is more readable by developers accustomed with the imperative syntax:

```clj
(-> arg
    (f)
    (g)
    (h))
```

The expression is now much more readable, because the order of
execution is linear/sequential from top to bottom.

> NOTE 1: `arg` is implicitly passed to `f` as its first argument, the
> result of `f` is then implicitly passed as first argument to the
> next function and so on. This is why `->` is called threading first
> macro.

Note that the entire computation is blocked until each callee returns
its result to the corresponding caller. This model of computation is
said **synchronous**.

The problem with the synchronous model of computation is of efficiency
nature. Say that the `g` function internally does a long I/O
operation, the next `h` function has to wait until `g` returns, and
the system does not use its resources for doing something useful in
the meantime.

To overcome this kind of paralysis, which is especially annoying in
the user interface context, it has been introduced the
[event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)
paradigm in which the flow of the program execution is no more
sequential, but it's determined by events such user actions, sensors
output or messages from other programs/thread.

## Function chains make poor machine

As usual, by solving a problem, we're frequently creating the premises
for a new problem ready to later manifest itself. In an event-driven
approach, there is usually a main loop listening for events of various
types. When an event type appears, the loop triggers a function,
conveniently known as callback, that has been previously attached to
the corresponding event type. This is exactly what we did in the
previous tutorials on DOM manipulation when we attached few listeners
(another name for callbacks) to various user generated events:
`click`, `blur`, `input`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, etc.

This way, the logic of the program starts to get fragmented in more
places. When the application becomes more complex, as it happens
within a Single Page Application, it becomes very difficult to reason
about the application logic and its state as well. A triggered
callback triggers in turn another callback, which triggers a third
callback an so on. This situation is very well known in the JS
programming language and it also deserved a name: callback hell:

```js
a(function (resultFromA) {
  b(resultFromA, function (resultFromB) {
    c(resultFromB, function (resultFromC) {
      d
```






As said by Rich Hickey in presenting the `core.async` library, *"there
comes a time in all good programs when component or subsystem must
stop communicating directly with one another."*

To explain this statement, we're going to steal a Tim Baldridge's
example.

Let's say we have to simulate a car factory. You'll probably end up
with something like this:

```clj
(defn make-car []
    (-> (make-frame)
        (add-body)
        (map (add-tire) (make-tire 5))
        (add-engine (make-engine))))
```

Here, we modeled a single sequential process, where each function
directly communicates with one another. The result of calling the
`make-frame` is passed down to the `add-body` function. In turn, the
result of `add-body` is passed down to the next function and so on.

Even if this is the way we have been accustomed to code for decades
for simulating the real world, it's not the way the real world works
at the large. Each function of the above example can be represented as
an independent process communicating and coordinating itself with the
others via communication channels.
## Easy Start

Let's start very easy by first adding the `core.async` library to the
`:dependencies` section of the project's `build.boot` build file:

```clj
(set-env!
 ...
 :dependencies '[...
                 [org.clojure/core.async "0.2.374"]
                 ])
...
```
Then, start the CLJ REPL as usual:

```bash
boot repl
...
boot.user=>
```

and require the main `clojure.core.async` namespace:

```clj
boot.user> (require '[clojure.core.async :as a])
nil
```

```clj
(defn boring [msg]
  (loop [i 0]
    (println msg i)
    (Thread/sleep 1000)
    (recur (inc i))))
```

As you probably heard from Rich Hickey talk on `core.async`, *function
chains make poor machines*. What does it means? We should first find
out what are function chains and what are machine to be able to
eventually understand what does it means the function chains make poor
machine and why this statement should be true.

A function chain is very easy to be understand. It's just a function
calling another function, calling another function, and so on, like so:

```clj
boot.user> (defn f [n] n)
#'boot.user/f
boot.user> (defn g [n] (+ n 1))
#'boot.user/g
boot.user> (defn h [n] (+ n 1))
#'boot.user/h
boot.user> (h (g (f 1)))
3
```

As you see the `(h (g (f 1)))` start to be difficult to be read,
because Clojure, as any LISP has to be read from inside out. To
improve the readability of such a form, Clojure has the `->` first
thread macro

```clj
boot.user> (-> 1
               (f)
               (g)
               (h))
3
```

which is read as a sequence of functions in a more imperative way:

* get the number `1`
* apply to it the function `f`
* apply to the above result the function `g`
* apply to the above result the function `h`.

## Next Step - TBD
