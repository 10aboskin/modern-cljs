# Tutorial 21 The Real World

In the [previous tutorial][1] we did some housekeeping with the
`build.boot` building file to be able to install a CLJ/CLJS library to
the local `maven` repository and finally publish it to
[`clojars`](https://clojars.org/).

In this tutorial we'll came back to the Clojure(Script) programming
language by introducing the most explained and commented library in
the brief history of this awesome pair of programming languages:
[`core.async`](https://github.com/clojure/core.async).

## Preamble

To start working, assuming you've git installed, do as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
cd modern-cljs
git checkout se-tutorial-18
```

## Introduction

There is no way that I could explain the
[`core.async`](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) Contrib Library
any better than others already did, given that the others were
[Rich Hickey](https://github.com/richhickey), the inventor of
Clojure(Script) and of the `core.async` library as well,
[Timothy Baldridge](https://github.com/halgari), the guy that
implemented the
[`go` macro](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/a833f6262cdaf92c6b16dd201d1876e0de424e14/src/main/clojure/cljs/core/async/macros.clj)
and [David Nolen](), perhaps the most fruitful and persevering
clojurian and current maintainer of the ClojureScript compiler, where
the `core.async` library found its natural environment to live and
grow.

## Next Step - TBD
