# Tutorial 10 - Introducing Ajax

In the [last tutorial][1] we were happy enough with the reached results
in terms of [separation of concerns][2], functional programming style
and elimination of any direct use of CLJS/JS interop.

As we said in [Tutorial 4][3], the very first reason why JS adoption
became so intense had to do with its ability to easily support
client-side validation of HTML forms. The same thing we did from
[Tutorial 4][3] to [Tutorial 9][1].

Then, thanks to the introduction of [XmlHttpRequest][4] JS obejct and
the wide spread of gmail and google maps, the terms **ajax* and *web
2.0* became the most used web buzzwords all over the places and in a
very short time too.

# Introduction

Ajax is not something magic, it's just a kind of client-server
communication, eventually asyncronous, mainly using http/htts
protocols. Ajax expoits more [web techniques][5]:

* HTML and CSS for presentation
* DOM for dynamic display and interaction with data
* XML/JSON for the data representation
* XMLHttpRequest obecjt for aynchronous communication
* JAvaScript to bring all the above techniques together

Following is a sequence diagram which visualizes the above techniques
interaction applied to a form page example.

![Ajax Diagram][6]

As you can see, when a click event is raised, the corresponding event
handler calls the XHR object and registers a callback function, which
will be later notified with the response. The XHR object creates the
http request and sends it to the web server which selects and calls the
appropriate server side handler (i.e. application logic). The server
side handler then returns the response to the XHR object which parses
the response and notifies the result to the registered callback. The
callback function then will manipulate the DOM and/or the CSS of the
page to be shown by the browser to the user.

# No Ajax, no party

If CLJS did not have a way to implement ajax interaction model, it would
be dead before to be born. As usual, CLJS could exploit Google Closure
Library which includes the `goog.net` package to abstract the plain
`XmlHttpRequest` JS obecjt for supporting ajax communications with a
server from a web browser.

That said, directly interacting with `XmlHttpRequest` or with
`goog.net.XhrIo` and `goog.net.XhrManager` objects could easly become an
hard work to be done. Let's see if CLJS community has done something to
alleviate a sure PITA.

# Introducing shoreleave

After a brief github search, my collegues [Federico Boliardi][7] and
[Francesco Agozzino][8] found [shoreleave-remote][9] and
[shoreleave-remote-ring][10] libraries.  They seem immediatly to be
really promising in helping our ajax experiments if compared with
[fetch][11] library, which was the one I was aware of and that depends
on [noir][12] that has been recently [deprecated][13].

As you can read from its [readme][14], Shoreleave is a collection of
integrated libraries that focuses on

* Security
* Idiomatic interfaces
* Common client-side strategies
* HTML5 capabilities
* ClojureScript's advantages

and it builds upon efforts found in other ClojureScript projects, such
as Fetch and [ClojureScriptOne][15] which is like to say that it stands
on the shoulders of giants.

## KISS (Keep It Small and Stupid)

To keep things simple enough we're going to stay with our boring
shopping calculator form as a reference case to be implemented by using
shoreleave.

What we'd like to do is to move the calculation from the client side code
(i.e. CLJS) to the server side code (i.e. CLJ) and then let the former
asks the latter to produce the result to be then manipulated by CLJS.

The following sequence diagram visualizes our requirement.

![Shopping Ajax][16]

The first thing we want to do it's to implement the remote function to
calculate the total.

## shoreleave-remote-ring

Thanks to [Chas Emerick][17], which is one of the most active and
fruitful clojurist, we can exploit [shoreleave-remote-ring][10] by
definig a remote calculate function which will return out the result
(i.e. `total`) from the passed input (i.e. `quantity`, `price`, `tax`
and `discount`).

### Update dependencies

As usual we have first to add `shoreleave-remote-ring` library to
`project.clj`. Here is the corresponging code fragment.

```clojure

  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]
                 [compojure "1.1.3"]
                 [domina "1.0.0"]
                 [hiccups "0.1.1"]
                 [com.cemerick/shoreleave-remote-ring "0.0.2"]
                 [shoreleave/shoreleave-remote "0.2.2"]]
```

> NOTE 1: We added both `shoreleave-remote-ring` and `shoreleave-remote`
> libs. The last will be used to the client-side code (i.e. CLJS)

### defremote

Yhe next step is to define the remote function that implements the
calculation from `quantity`, `price`, `tax` and `discount` input. The
`shoreleave-remote-ring` library offers `defremote` macro which is just
like `defn` macro plus its registration in a registry of remote
functions implemented as a map.

Here is the definition of the remote `calculate` function. We decided to
add it to the `core.clj` file just for semplicity. Remeber to add
`cemerick.shoreleave.rpc` namespace to the namespace declaration.

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]]
            [compojure.route :refer [resources not-found]]
            [compojure.handler :refer [site]]
            [cemerick.shoreleave.rpc :refer [defremote wrap-rpc]]))

(defremote calculate [quantity price tax discount]
  (-> (* quantity price)
      (* (+ 1 (/ tax 100)))
      (- discount)))
```

> NOTE 2: If you compare the remote `calculate` function with the one
> originally defined in `shopping.cljs` client code in the [last tutorial][1],
> you should note that the call to `.toFixed` CLJS function interop has
> been removed.

> NOTE 3: The namespace declaration uses now only `:require` and
> `:refer` keywords just to make the code more readable. Generally
> speaking I prefer to use `:require` with `:as` specification, because
> it always allows me to immediatly see in which namespace a symbol is
> defined.
