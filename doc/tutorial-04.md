# Tutorial 4 - Modern ClojureScript

In this tutorial we're going to start the porting of few JavaScript (JS)
samples from the book [Modern JavaScript: Development and Desing][1] by
[Larry Ullman][2]. You can download the code of the book from [here][3].

The reason we choose [it][3] as a reference is because it starts
smoothly, but keeps a roboust approach to JS coding. We think that
bringing [Larry][2] approach from JS into ClojureScript (CLJS) could be
helpful to anyone not yet fluent in CLJS.

## Introduction

As anybody knows, in the 1990s JS has been prevalently used for improving and
validating HTML forms.
