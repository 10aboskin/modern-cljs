# Tutorial 17 - Less is more

In the [previous tutorial][1] we reached an important milestone on our
path towards the elimination of as much as possibile code
duplication. Indeed, we were able to share the same form validation
and corresponding unit testing codebase between the client and
server. Anytime in the future we should need to update the validation
rules and the corresponding unit testing too, we'll do it in one
shared place only, which is a big plus in terms of maintenence time
and costs.

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to integrate the validators for the
Shopping Calculator into the corresponding WUI (Web User Interface) in
such a way that the user will be notified with some error messages when
the she/he types in invalid values in the form.

We have two options. We can be religious about the progressive
enhancement strategy or be more agnostic. Although this series of
tutorials is mainly dedicated to CLJS, we decided to be less agnostic
than usual and we're going to start by integrating the validators in
the server-side code first, and forget for a while about CLJS/JS code.

## Prepare the field for the HTML transformation

We already used the [Envlive][2] lib in the
[Tutorial 14 - It's better to be safe than sorry (Part 1) - ][3] to
implement the server-side only Shopping Calculator. Even if we were a
little bit stingy in explaining the [Enlive][2] mechanics, we were
able to directly connect the `/shopping` action coming from the
`shoppingForm` submission to the `shopping` template by exploiting the
fact the `deftemplate` macro implicitly define a function with the
same name of the defining template.

```clj
;; src/clj/modern_cljs/core.clj
;; the `/shopping` URI is linked to the `shopping` function
(POST "/shopping" [quantity price tax discount]
        (shopping quantity price tax discount))
```

```clj
;; src/clj/modern_cljs/templates/shopping.clj
;; deftemplate implicitly define the `shopping` function
(deftemplate shopping "public/shopping.html"
  [quantity price tax discount]
  [:#quantity] (set-attr :value quantity)
  [:#price] (set-attr :value price)
  [:#tax] (set-attr :value tax)
  [:#discount] (set-attr :value discount)
  [:#total] (set-attr :value 
                      (format "%.2f" (calculate quantity price tax discount))))
```

However, as we saw in the
[Tutorial 15 - It's better to be safe than sorry (Part 2) - ][4], we
can break the `shoppingForm` by just typing in the form a value that's
not a numeber, because the `calculate` function is able to deal with
stringified numbers only.

![ServerNullPointer][5]

### Refatoring to inject the form validators

We now need to refactor again the code. We want to insert a call to
the `validate-shopping-form` validation function between the received
request (i.e. `POST "/shopping"`) and the `shopping` function call, in
such a way that when any typed in value is invalid we can notify the
corresponding error message to the user by transforming/manipulting
the `shoppingForm` form.

#### Step 1

So, instead of directly associate to the `POST "/shopping` request the
corresponding function implicitly defined by the `deftemplate` macro,
we are going to associate to it a new function, which intermediates
the call for rendering HTML page by first getting the result from the
`validate-shopping-form` validation function.

Open the `shopping.clj` source file from the
`src/clj/modern-cljs/templates` directory and modify it as follows.

```clj
(ns modern-cljs.templates.shopping
  (:require [net.cgrand.enlive-html :refer [deftemplate set-attr]]
            [modern-cljs.remotes :refer [calculate]]
            [modern-cljs.shopping.validators :refer [validate-shopping-form]]))

(deftemplate shopping-template "public/shopping.html"
  [quantity price tax discount errors]
  [:#quantity] (set-attr :value quantity)
  [:#price] (set-attr :value price)
  [:#tax] (set-attr :value tax)
  [:#discount] (set-attr :value discount)
  [:#total] (set-attr :value 
                      (format "%.2f" (calculate quantity price tax discount))))

(defn shopping [q p t d]
  (shopping-template q p t d (validate-shopping-form q p t d)))
```

First we added the `modern-cljs.shopping.validators`
namespace requirement to be able to refer the `validate-shopping-form`
function.

Then we defined a new `shopping` function which receives the arguments
from the `POST "/shopping"` request. The new `shopping` function calls
a new `shopping-template` function, implicitly defined by
`deftemplate`, by passing to it all the received args *PLUS* the
result of the `validate-shopping-form` validators.

Finally we renamed the template from `shopping` to `shopping-template`
and added as a fifth argument the result of the form input validation.

> NOTE 1: By defining the new intermediate function with the same name
> (i.e. `shopping`) previoulsly associate with the `POST "/shopping"`
> request, we needn't to modify the `defroutes` macro call in the
> `modern-cljs.core` namespace.

#### Step 2

For each input field we now need to substitute in the `deftemplate`
macro call the original transformer (i.e. `set-attr`) with a new one
which receives both the value typed in by the user and, if the value
was invalid, the corresponding error message produced by the
`validate-shopping-form` validation function.

In the same `shopping.clj` source file modify the content by adding a
new `update-attr` function definition and by updating the
`shopping-template` defintion as follows:

```clj
(defn update-attr [value error]
  (set-attr :value value))

(deftemplate shopping-template "public/shopping.html"
  [quantity price tax discount errors]
  [:#quantity] (update-attr quantity (first (:quantity errors)))
  [:#price] (update-attr price (first (:price errors)))
  [:#tax] (update-attr tax (first (:tax errors)))
  [:#discount] (update-attr discount (first (:discount errors)))
  [:#total] (set-attr :value 
                      (format "%.2f" (calculate quantity price tax discount))))
```

At the moment the `update-attr` is just calling the `set-attr`
function and substitutes all its occurrences, but the last one, in the
`shopping-template` definition. This is because we want to verify that
the code refactoring done until now does not break the application.

Now run the server as usual

```bash
$ lein ring server-headless
```

and disable the JavaScript engine of your browser. Then visit the
[shopping.html][10] URL, fill the form with valid values and click the
`Calculate` function. Everything should still work as before the code
refactoring.

## HTML transformation

In [Tutorial 14 - It's better to be safe than sorry - ][3] we
introduced [Enlive][2], but we did not say to much about it, both
because there are already good tutorials available online and because
this series of tutorial is about CLJS more than about CLJ.

### Don't panic

While the [Enlive][2] `deftemplate` macro seems to be very easy to be
used, is has a very convoluted definition. In fact it is a
[syntactic sugar][6] used to make it esier for the programmer to
express in a more readable form for a very convoluted sequence of
activities.

The `deftemplate` macro does a lot of things:

1. reads a static resource (e.g. an HTML source file)
   and parses it in a sequence of nodes; 
2. defines a function with the same name and the same arguments of the template;
4. for each CSS-like selectors form selects the matching nodes from
   the resulted sequence of nodes from the parsing of the HTML source
5. apply each transformation form to each node selected from the
   corresponding CSS-like selectors form.

Moreover, each transformation is both a [closure][7] and a
[HOF][8]. It's difficult to not panic with such a complex structure to
be uderstood, but if we stay focused to our intent we can afford it.

First we should clarify to ourself what kind of transformation we want
to operate on the HTML page when there is any input value that is
invalid.

We start from the following HTML snippet of code from the `shopping.html` file which resides in the `resources/public` directory.

```html
<div>
   <label for="price">Price Per Unit</label>
   <input type="text"
          name="price"
          id="price"
          value="1.00"
          required>
</div>
```

Even if I'm very bad both in HTML and CSS, I think that the following
could be an acceptable transformation of the original HTML snippet to
notify the user of the invalid `price` value.

```html
<div>
   <label for="price" class="error">Price has to be a number</label>
   <input type="text"
          name="price"
          id="price"
          value="foo"
          required>
</div>
```

![priceError][9]

Here we substituted the `content` of the `label` associated to the
`price` input filed with the corresponding error massage received from
the `validate-shopping-form`.
