# Tutorial 6 - Trouble Shootin Session

In this tutorial we are going to investigate the issue we met in the
[last tutorial][1] and try to solve it.

## Introduction

Last tutorial ended with a not so nice issue. Just to recap we did as
follows:

* created the `login.html` page and the corresponding `login.cljs`
  source file;
* created the `shopping.html` page and the corresponding
  `shopping.cljs` source file;
* launched the app in the usual way

```bash
$ lein ring server # from the project home directory
$ lein cljsbuild auto # from the project home directory in a new terminal
$ lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen # from the project home directory in a new terminal
```

We than visited the [shopping][2] page in the browser and discovered
that the `init` function we set for the `onload` property of the JS
`window` object was not the one we defined in `shopping.cljs`, but the
one we defined in `login.cljs`.

As we anticipated in the [previous tutorial][1], this behaviour
depends from Google Closure Compiler driven by `lein-cljsbuild`
plugin. 

## Introducing Google Closure Compiler (CLS)

In the [first tutorial][3], we set the `:cljsbuild` keyword of
`project.clj` to configure Google Closure Compiler options:

```clojure
(defproject ....  
  ...
  :cljsbuild {:builds
              [{:source-path "src/cljs"
                :compiler {:output-to "resources/public/js/modern.js"
                           :optimizations :whitespace
                            :pretty-print true}}]})

```

The `:source-path` option instructs CLS to look for any CLJS source
code in the `src/cljs` directory structure. The `:output-to` option of
the `:compiler` keyword instructs CLS to save the compilation result
in the `"resources/public/js/modern.js` file. 

I'm not going to explain every single detail of CLJS/CLS pair of
compilers. The only detail it is useful to recap to investigate and
eventually to solve the above issue is that the CLSJ/CLS compilers
generates a **single** JS file
(e.g. `"resources/public/js/modern.js"`) from **all** the CLJS files
it finds in `"src/cljs"` directory/subdirectories
(e.g. `connect.cljs`, `login.cljs`, `modern.cljs` and
`shopping.cljs`). 

## Is mutability evil?

Both `login.cljs` and `shopping.cljs` had a final call to `(set!
(.-onload js/window) init)`, which is then called two times: once from
`login.cljs` and once from `shopping.cljs`. The order of these calls
doesn't matter, because whichever comes first, the other is going to
mutate its previous value: a clear case against JS mutable data
structure?

## Easy made complex

From the above discussion the reader could start bilieving in the
statement that CLJS is good only for *single page browser
application*. Indeed, there is a very modest solution to the above
conflict between more calls setting the same `onload` property of the
JS `window` object: duplication! 

You have to duplicate the directory structure and the corresponding
build options for each html page is going to include that single
generated JS file.

Here are the bash commands you should enter in the terminal.

```bash
$ mkdir -p src/cljs/{login/modern_cljs,shopping/modern_cljs}
$ mv src/cljs/modern_cljs/login.cljs src/cljs/login/modern_cljs/
$ mv src/cljs/modern_clsj/shopping.cljs src/cljs/shopping/modern_cljs/
$ cp src/cljs/modern_cljs/connect.cljs src/cljs/login/modern_cljs/
$ cp src/cljs/modern_cljs/connect.cljs src/cljs/shopping/modern_cljs/
$ rm -rf src/cljs/modern_cljs
```

And here is the modified fragment of `project.clj`

```clojure
(defproject ...
  ...
  
  :cljsbuild
  {:builds
   
   ;; login.js build
   {:login
    {:source-path "src/cljs/login"
     :compiler
     {:output-to "resources/public/js/login.js"
      :optmizations :whitespace
      :pretty-print true}}
    ;; shopping.js build
    :shopping
    {:source-path "src/cljs/shopping"
     :compiler
     {:output-to "resources/public/js/shopping.js"
      :optmizations :whitespace
      :pretty-print true}}}})
```

Finally you have to include the right JS file (e.g. `"js/login.js"`
and `"js/shopping.js"` in the script tag of each html page
(e.g. `login.html` and `shopping.html`).

Rich would call the above solution a kind of **incidental
complexity**. What's worst is the fact that each JS emitted file, no
matter how smart is the CLS compiler in reducing the total size of
each generated JS file, is different form the other: no way for the
browser to cache the first downloaded one to locally serve all the
others from the cache.

## Simple made easy

Now the simple made easy way:

* remove the call `(set! (.-onsubmit js/document) init)` from both
  `login.cljs` and `shopping.cljs` files;
* add the `:export` tag to the `init` function in both `login.cljs` and
  `shopping.cljs` files;
* add a `script` tag calling the correponding `init` function in both
  `login.html` and `shopping.html` files;
* you're done. 

Here is the interested fragment of `login.cljs`

```clojure
;; the rest as before
(defn ^:export init []
  (if (and js/document
           (.-getElementById js/document))
    ;; get loginForm by element id and set its onsubmit property to
    ;; validate-form function
    (let [login-form (.getElementById js/document "loginForm")]
      (set! (.-onsubmit login-form) validate-form))))

;; (set! (.-onload js/window) init)
```

And here is the interested fragment of `shopping.cljs`

```clojure
;; the rest as before
(defn ^:export init []
  (if (and js/document
           (.-getElementById js/document))
    (let [theForm (.getElementById js/document "shoppingForm")]
      (set! (.-onsubmit theForm) calculate))))

;; (set! (.-onload js/window) init)

```
Here is the interested fragment of `login.html`

```html
    <script src="js/modern.js"></script>
    <script>modern_cljs.login.init();</script>
```

And here is the interested fragment of `shopping.html`

```html
  <script src="js/modern.js"></script>
  <script>modern_cljs.shopping.init();</script>
```

You can now run everything as usual:

```bash
$ lein ring server # from the project home directory
$ lein cljsbuild auto # from the project home directory in a new terminal
$ lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen # from the project home directory in a new terminal
```
