# modern-cljs

A series of tutorials to guide you in creating and setting up
[ClojureScript][5] (CLJS) projects.

# Introduction

This series of tutorials will guide you in creating, setting up and
running simple CLJS projects. The series follows a progressive
enhancement of projects themselves.

Assuming you already have installed [leiningen][9], to run the last
available tutorial without coding:

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git`
2. `$ cd modern-cljs`
3. ` $ lein ring server`
4. open a new terminal and cd in modern-cljs
5. `$ lein cljsbuild once`
6. `$ lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen`
7. visit [login-dbg.html][11] and/or [shopping-dbg.html][15]
8. play with the repl connected to the browser

> NOTE: If you want to access the code of any single tutorial because
> you don't want to `copy&paste` it or you don't want to write it
> yourself, do as follows:
>
> * `$ git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git` (if you
>   have not already done);
> * `$ cd modern-cljs`
> * `$ git checkout tut-01 # for tutorial 1, tut-02 for tutorial 2 etc.`
>
> That said, I suggest coding yourself the content of the tutorials. In
> my experience is always the best choice if you are not already fluent
> in the programming language you have under your fingers.

## [Tutorial 1 - The basic][1]

In the first tutorial you are going to create and configure a very basic
CLJS project.

## [Tutorial 2 - Browser CLJS REPL (bREPL)][2]

In this tutorial you are going to set up a browser connected CLJS REPL
(bRepl) using an external http-server.

## [Tutorial 3 - CLJ based http-server][3]

In this tutorial you are going to substitute the external http-server
with [ring][4], a CLJ based http-server.

## [Tutorial 4 - Modern ClojureScript][6]

In this tutorial we start having some fun with CLJS form validation, by
porting from JS to CLJS the login form example of
[Modern Javascript: Development and desing][7] by [Larry Ullman][8].

## [Tutorial 5 - Introducing Domina][12]

In this tutorial we're going to use [domina library][13] to make our
login form validation more clojure-ish.

## [Tutorial 6 - Easy made Complex and Simple made Easy][14]

In this tutorial we're going to investigate and solve in two different
ways the not so nice issue we met in the last tutorial.

##  [Tutorial 7 - Being doubly aggressive][16]

In this tutorial we're going to explore CLJS/CLS compilation modes by
using the usual `lein-cljsbuild` plugin of `leiningen`, but we'll
discover a trouble we do not know how to manage yet.

## [Tutorial 8 - Learn by contributing][17]

In this tutorial we're going to patch CLJS compiler for solving 
the code duplication trouble we met in the previous tutorial.

## Tutorial 9 - To be done
