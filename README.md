# modern-cljs

A series of tutorials to guide you in creating and setting up
[ClojureScript][5] (CLJS) projects.

# Introduction

This series of tutorials will guide you in creating, setting up and
running simple CLJS projects. The series follows a progressive
enhancement of projects themselves.

## [Tutorial 1 - The basic][1]

In the first tutorial you are going to create and configure a very basic
CLJS project.

## [Tutorial 2 - Browser CLJS REPL (bREPL)][2]

In this tutorial you are going to set up a browser connected CLJS REPL
(bRepl) using an external http-server.

## [Tutorial 3 - CLJ based http-server][3]

In this tutorial you are going to substitute the external http-server
with [ring][4], a CLJ based http-server.
